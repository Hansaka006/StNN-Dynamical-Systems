# StNN-Dynamical-Systems
This repository contains the implementation of a structured neural network (StNN) based on the Hankel operator for solving dynamical systems. The project includes numerical simulations comparing StNN with conventional neural networks, Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), and HAVOK.
